I am going to move to a new place tomorrow.
The area where I am staying is very convenient and beautiful.
But things are a bit expensive here.
Moreover, it is a bit far from the company I am working for.
So, whenever I have something to deal with as a kind of work, I should take a cab and go to the company.
It is energy-consuming.
The new apartment I am supposed to live in starting tomorrow is very big.
The apartment has three rooms and two bathrooms.
The best thing is that the apartment has a lot of coworkers.
I do not talk using my personal computer anymore.
I want to talk looking at her or his face.

Tomorrow I am going to the hospital near the company  which I am working for and getting the COVID19 vaccine.
A coworker from Vietnam called me and let me know that I should hurry up and get the vaccine this weekend.
Of course, getting the vaccine does not mean I can get around anywhere freely.
But, if I get the vaccine twice, I can visit other areas such as Kuala Lumpur.

Today I took a taxi  and went to the area near the company where I am working now.
It was because I had to see the apartment where I am supposed to live starting next month.
The driver was a Chinese Malaysian.
He could speak English.
But his English was not that great.
I tried asking him if he is Chinese Malaysian.
He said yes.
We talked about foreigners living in Penang.
He said there are lots of foreigners in Penang.
He also said there are many Japanese and Koreans.
He said there are lots of Westerners as well.
He said that because of COVID19 foreigners can’t visit Penang and its economic damage has been huge.
Of course, I couldn’t understand everything he said.
But I was able to talk in Chinese more fluently than before.
I was excited.

Today, I ran for about an hour after work.
And I bought two hamburgers at a stall.
Currently, the situation of COVID19 in Malaysia is so serious that the business hours of all stores are limited to 8 o'clock.
It was already 7:30 after jogging.
I thought it would be impossible to visit the supermarket nearby and shop for groceries.
The problem was that  I had only four apples and three bottles of mineral water in the fridge.
The burgers were so cheap!
Moreover, the people there were so nice.
One burger is for today’s dinner.
The other one is for tomorrow’s breakfast.
I think I don’t have to  go to McDonald’s anymore.

Today I woke up at 6 O’ clock  in the morning.
From 6 O’clock I ran for about an hour.
I had breakfast at 7:30.
I ate toast and sausages for breakfast.
I also drank orange juice and coffee.
Orange juice over here in Malaysia is too sweet.
I think orange juice from Japan is tastier.
From 8 am to 5 pm I took the job training using my desktop.
All the coworkers I am taking the training with are nice.
They come from Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippine.
I edited some videos I had taken.
It seems that lots of my friends are interested in Malaysia.
That’s why more friends of mine seem to watch my Youtube videos.
I will try harder to make better Youtube videos.
